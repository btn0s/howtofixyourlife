If you're anything like me, you think new years resolutions are stupid.

Because most people go about changing their lives in the completely wrong way. They create these resolutions because everyone else does – we create a superficial meaning out of status games – but they don't meet the requirements for true change, which goes a lot deeper than convincing yourself you're going to be more disciplined or productive this year.

If you're one of these people, I'm not here to talk down on you. I've quit 10x more goals than I've achieved. I think that should be the case for most people. But the fact that people try to change their lives and utterly fail almost every time holds true.

However, as much as I think new years resolutions are stupid, it's always wise to reflect on the life you hate so you can launch yourself toward something that much better, as we will discuss.

So whether you want to start the business, transform your body, or take the risk toward a more meaningful life without quitting after 2 weeks, I want to share 7 ideas you probably haven't heard before on behavior change, psychology, and productivity so you can do just that in 2026.

This will be comprehensive. This isn't one of those letters that you read through and forget about. This is something you will want to bookmark, take notes on, and set aside time to think about.

The protocol at the end will take about a full day to complete, with effects that last far longer than that.

Let's begin.

Section 1: You aren't where you want to be because you aren't the person who would be there.

When it comes to setting big goals, people tend to focus on one of two requirements for success: First, changing your actions to make progress toward the goal. This is least important, second order. Second, changing who you are so that your behavior naturally follows. This is most important, first order.

Most people set a surface-level goal, hype themselves up to remain disciplined for the first few weeks, then go back to their old ways without much struggle, because they were trying to build a great life on a rotting foundation.

Think of somebody successful. It can be a bodybuilder with a great physique, a founder worth hundreds of millions, or a charismatic person who can chat up a group without a shred of anxiety entering their mind.

Do you think the bodybuilder has to "grind" to eat healthy? Does the CEO have to discipline themselves to show up and lead the team? The truth is that they can't see themselves living any other way. The bodybuilder has to grind to eat unhealthily. The CEO has to force themselves to lie in bed past their alarm clock, and they hate every second of it.

This next sentence may sound simple, but it is baffling how many people don't get it.

If you want a specific outcome in life, you must have the lifestyle that creates that outcome long before you reach it.

When you truly change yourself, all of your habits that don't move the needle toward your goal become disgusting, because you have a deep and profound awareness of what kind of life those actions compound into.

Section 2: You aren't where you want to be because you don't want to be there.

Alfred Adler said: Trust only movement. Life happens at the level of events, not of words. Trust movement.

If you want to change who you are, you must understand how the mind works so that you can start to reprogram it.

The first step is to understand that all behavior is goal-oriented. It's teleological. You take a step forward because you want to reach a certain location. You scratch your nose because you want to make the itch go away.

Most of the time, your goals are unconscious. On an even more unconscious level, you pursue goals that can harm you, but you justify your actions in a way that is socially acceptable.

If you can't stop procrastinating your work, you may justify it by saying you "lack discipline," but in reality, you are attempting to achieve a goal. That goal could be to protect yourself from the judgment that comes from finishing and sharing your work.

The lesson here is that real change requires changing your goals. I mean changing your point of view. Because that's what a goal is. A goal is a projection into the future that acts as a lens of perception.

Section 3: You aren't where you want to be because you're afraid to be there.

Here's how you've become who you are today. This is the anatomy of identity:

You want to achieve a goal. You perceive reality through the lens of that goal. You only notice important information that helps you achieve that goal. You act toward that goal and receive feedback. You repeat that behavior until it becomes automatic. That behavior becomes a part of who you think you are. You defend your identity to maintain psychological consistency. Your identity shapes new goals, restarting the cycle.

The unfortunate reality is that you must break this cycle, but this process starts when you are a child. You have the goal of survival. You are dependent on your parents to teach you how to survive.

When your identity feels threatened, you go into fight or flight. If you are heavily identified with a political ideology, you will feel threatened when someone challenges your beliefs. You literally feel the stress.

Section 4: The life you want lies within a specific level of mind.

The mind evolves through predictable stages over time. When you're born, you're like a little survival sponge that absorbs whatever beliefs you can so that you can feel safe and secure.

Here's the 80/20 of the 9 stages of ego development:

Impulsive: No separation between impulse and action. Black and white thinking.

Self-Protective: The world is dangerous and you learn to look out for yourself.

Conformist: You are your group and its rules feel like reality itself.

Self-Aware: You notice you have an inner life that doesn't match the exterior.

Conscientious: You build your own system of principles and hold yourself accountable to them.

Individualist: You see that your principles were shaped by context and start holding them more loosely.

Strategist: You work with systems while aware of your own involvement in them.

Construct-Aware: You see all frameworks, including your identity, as useful fictions.

Unitive: Separation between self and life dissolves. Work, rest, and play feel like the same thing.

The good thing is, it doesn't really matter what stage you are in, because moving through any of them follows a pattern.

Section 5: Intelligence is the ability to get what you want out of life.

Naval Ravikant said: The only real test of intelligence is if you get what you want out of life.

There is a formula for success. One ingredient is agency. One ingredient is opportunity. The last ingredient is intelligence.

Cybernetics comes from the greek word meaning "to steer" or "good at steering." It's also known as "the art of getting what you want."

Cybernetics illustrates the properties of intelligent systems: To have a goal. Act toward that goal. Sense where you are. Compare it to the goal. And act again based on that feedback.

High intelligence is the ability to iterate, persist, and understand the big picture. The mark of low intelligence is the inability to learn from your mistakes.

Goals determine how you see the world. Goals determine what you consider "success" or "failure."

To become more intelligent, you must: Reject the known path. Dive into the unknown. Set new, higher goals to expand your mind. Embrace the chaos and allow for growth. Study the generalized principles of nature. Become a deep generalist.

Section 6: How to launch into a completely new life in 1 day.

The best periods of my life always came after a period of getting absolutely fed up with the lack of progress I was making.

How do you dig into your mind? How do you become aware of your conditioning? Through the simple, but often painful act of questioning.

I want to give you a comprehensive protocol that you can use every year to reset your life. This protocol helps you ask the right questions.

When I observe patterns in people who successfully flip their identity, it happens fast after a build up of tension. I've noticed 3 phases: Dissonance, where they feel like they don't belong in their current life. Uncertainty, where they don't know what comes next. And Discovery, where they discover what they want to pursue and make 6 years of progress in 6 months.

This protocol is structured to be completed in one day. In the morning, you do a psychological excavation. During the day, you prompt yourself with interrupts. At night, you synthesize the insights into a direction.

Part 1, Morning: Psychological Excavation, Vision and Anti-Vision.

First we must create a new frame for your mind to operate from. Set aside 15 to 30 minutes to answer these questions.

What is the dull and persistent dissatisfaction you've learned to live with?

What do you complain about repeatedly but never actually change?

For each complaint: What would someone who watched your behavior conclude that you actually want?

What truth about your current life would be unbearable to admit to someone you deeply respect?

If absolutely nothing changes for the next five years, describe an average Tuesday. Where do you wake up? What does your body feel like? What's the first thing you think about?

Now do it but for ten years. What have you missed? What opportunities closed? Who gave up on you?

You're at the end of your life. You lived the safe version. You never broke the pattern. What was the cost?

Who in your life is already living the future you just described? What do you feel when you think about becoming them?

What identity would you have to give up to actually change?

What is the most embarrassing reason you haven't changed?

If your current behavior is a form of self-protection, what exactly are you protecting?

Now, we need to orient that energy in a positive direction. We need to create a minimum viable vision.

Forget practicality for a minute. If you could snap your fingers and be living a different life in three years, what does an average Tuesday look like?

What would you have to believe about yourself for that life to feel natural? Write the identity statement: "I am the type of person who..."

What is one thing you would do this week if you were already that person?

Part 2, Throughout The Day: Interrupting Autopilot.

Throughout the day, contemplate on everything you journaled. Create reminders in your phone with these questions:

11am: What am I avoiding right now by doing what I'm doing?

1:30pm: If someone filmed the last two hours, what would they conclude I want from my life?

3:15pm: Am I moving toward the life I hate or the life I want?

5pm: What's the most important thing I'm pretending isn't important?

7:30pm: What did I do today out of identity protection rather than genuine desire?

9pm: When did I feel most alive today? When did I feel most dead?

Part 3, Evening: Synthesizing Insight.

After today, what feels most true about why you've been stuck?

What is the actual enemy? Name it clearly. Not circumstances. Not other people. The internal pattern or belief that has been running the show.

Write a single sentence that captures what you refuse to let your life become. This is your anti-vision compressed.

Write a single sentence that captures what you're building toward. This is your vision MVP.

Lastly, we need to create goals. Think of goals as a lens that you can exchange to enter the right state of mind.

One-year lens: What would have to be true in one year for you to know you've broken the old pattern?

One-month lens: What would have to be true in one month for the one-year lens to remain possible?

Daily lens: What are 2 to 3 actions you can timeblock tomorrow that the person you're becoming would simply do?

Section 7: Turn Your Life Into A Video Game.

Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi said: The optimal state of inner experience is one in which there is order in consciousness. This happens when psychic energy is invested in realistic goals, and when skills match the opportunities for action.

You now have all of the components that lead to a good life. Organize all of your insights into one coherent plan with these 6 components:

Anti-vision: What is the bane of my existence, or the life I never want to experience again?

Vision: What is the ideal life that I think I want?

1 year goal: What will my life look like in 1 year time?

1 month project: What do I need to learn? What skills do I need to acquire?

Daily levers: What are the priority, needle-moving tasks?

Constraints: What am I not willing to sacrifice?

These components create your own little world. You turn your life into a video game.

Games are the poster child for obsession, enjoyment, and flow states. They have all the components that lead to focus and clarity.

Your vision is how you win. Your anti-vision is what's at stake. Your 1 year goal is the mission. Your 1 month project is the boss fight. Your daily levers are the quests. Your constraints are the rules.

All of these act as a concentric set of circles, like a forcefield, that guard your mind from distractions.

The more you play the game, the stronger this force becomes, and soon enough it becomes who you are, and you wouldn't have it any other way.
